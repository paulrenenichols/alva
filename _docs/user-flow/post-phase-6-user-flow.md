## Data Flow Analysis

### Onboarding Data:

- **Current**: Stored in Zustand with localStorage persistence
- **Structure**: Matches documented card structure but simplified
- **API Integration**: Basic integration with `apiClient.generatePlan()`
- **Missing**: Proper section-based auto-save, client profile mapping

### Authentication Flow:

- **Current**: Basic email registration → verification → dashboard

## Recommendations for Phase 7+

### Priority 1 (Critical):

1. **Implement Chat Functionality**: Complete AI chat interface with context awareness
2. **Fix Email Verification Flow**: Proper verification modal and magic link flow

4. **Implement Section-Based Routing**: Change from generic card routing to section-specific

### Priority 2 (Important):

1. **Enhance Task Management**: Convert to Kanban board with drag & drop
2. **Improve API Integration**: Replace mock data with real API calls
3. **Add External Integrations**: Google Calendar, ClickUp, email providers
4. **Mobile Optimization**: Implement mobile-specific interactions

### Priority 3 (Nice to Have):

1. **Advanced Dashboard Features**: Deadlines, streaks, detailed analytics
2. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Comprehensive error recovery and user guidance
3. **Performance Optimization**: Loading states, caching, optimization
4. **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance, keyboard navigation, screen reader support

## Conclusion

The Alva web application has successfully implemented approximately 70% of the documented user flow, with strong foundations in onboarding, dashboard structure, and basic authentication. The core user journey from landing to dashboard access is functional, but several critical features are missing or incomplete.

The most significant gaps are the chat functionality (completely missing) and the email verification flow (partially implemented). The onboarding experience is well-structured but uses a simplified routing approach compared to the documented section-based routing.

With focused development on the Priority 1 items, the application could achieve full compliance with the documented user flow within 1-2 development phases.
