## Ready for Development

**Status**: ✅ **Documentation Complete - Updated for Microservices Architecture**

## Recent Updates (Architecture Revision)

**Major Changes**:
1. **Architecture**: Shifted from monolithic Next.js to microservices (Web, API, Auth)
2. **Auth**: Replaced NextAuth.js with custom Fastify auth service + JWT tokens
3. **API**: Replaced tRPC with REST APIs (Fastify) + OpenAPI documentation
4. **Communication**: JWT-based authentication between services (RS256)
5. **Database**: Shared Postgres with separate schemas (auth + app)

**Documents Updated**:
- ✅ `architecture.md` - New document with microservices recommendations
- ✅ `tech-stack.md` - Updated for Fastify, REST APIs, JWT auth
- ✅ `project-rules.md` - Added service-specific structures and communication patterns
- ✅ `user-flow.md` - Updated auth flow for separate auth service
- ✅ `01-setup-phase.md` - Build all 3 services from start
- ✅ `02-mvp-phase.md` - API server integration for business logic
- ✅ `03-core-modules-phase.md` - Clarified all modules in API service
- ✅ `04-polish-phase.md` - Multi-service deployment and monitoring
- ✅ `README.md` - Updated getting started and architecture overview
- ✅ `PROJECT_STATUS.md` - This file

**Rationale for Changes**:
- Better separation of concerns (auth, business logic, UI)
- Independent scaling (auth vs API vs web have different needs)
- Security isolation (auth breach doesn't compromise API)
- Technology flexibility (different frameworks per service)
- Clearer boundaries for team organization

---

The project has a solid foundation to begin implementation. All team members (developers, designers, product) have clear guidance on:

- What to build (features and specs) 
- How to build it (microservices architecture, tech stack, patterns)
- Why decisions were made (rationale documented, alternatives considered)
- When to build what (phased approach with 3-service architecture)

**Next Action**: Initialize NX workspace with 3 applications and begin Setup Phase

---

_This project embodies AI-first development principles with comprehensive, navigable, and actionable documentation optimized for both human developers and AI coding assistants._
