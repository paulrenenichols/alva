- Performance → Budgets, monitoring, optimization phase
- Security → Rate limiting, input validation, audits
- Scale → Tested deployment strategy, monitoring

---

## Ready for Development

**Status**: ✅ **Documentation Complete - Ready to Begin Phase 1**

The project has a solid foundation to begin implementation. All team members (developers, designers, product) have clear guidance on:

- What to build (features and specs)
- How to build it (tech stack and patterns)
- Why decisions were made (rationale documented)
- When to build what (phased approach)

**Next Action**: Initialize NX workspace and begin Setup Phase
